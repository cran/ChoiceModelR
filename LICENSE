Program Name: ChoiceModelR
MCMC Algorithm for Hierarchical Multinomial Logit (MNL) with Normal Heterogeneity

A program to analyze choice and share-of-choices data.  Predictor variables
may be naturally occuring or, preferably, based on an experimental design 
which optimally selects particular combinations of levels of predictor 
variables.  Model outputs may be used to predict future scenarios or to 
identify optimal solutions.

This program builds upon the excellent work of Peter Rossi, Ph.D., 
Anderson School, UCLA.  In particular it builds on the rhierMnlRwMixture
program of the R Language package, bayesm, authored by Peter Rossi.
